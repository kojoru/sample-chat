# sample-chat
I try to write a simple polling chat in modern php without any frameworks

Running it
----------

1. Install docker-compose: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose

2. Run ``` docker-compose up ``` in the folder. It will install everything it needs to run in two docker containers and start hosting the result on http://localhost:8081
