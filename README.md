# sample-chat
I try to write a simple polling chat in modern php without any frameworks

Running it
----------

1. Install [php 7.2](http://php.net/manual/en/install.php), [composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx), 
   [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose)

2. Run ``` composer install ``` to install the dependencies.

2. Run ``` docker-compose up ``` in the folder. It will install everything it needs to run the app in two docker 
   containers and start hosting the result on http://localhost:8081
